The ones we will be focusing on in this website are:\n\n-   **HP**: Hit points. This determines how much damage a character can take before being 'downed'.\n\n-   **AC:** Armor class. This determines how difficult it is for an enemy to hit the character with an attack.\n\n-   **Str:** Strength score. This determines how effective a character is at strength-related skills and actions, including how well they attack with certain types of strength-based weapons.\n\n-   **Dex:** Dexterity score. This determines how effective a character is at dexterity-related skills and actions, including how well they attack with certain types of dexterity-based weapons. A character's Dex also determines how fast they act in turn order during combat, and sometimes affects their AC as well.\n\n-   **Con:** Constitution score. This determines how effective a character is at resisting health-related effects, as well as how much HP a character has.\n\n-   **Int:** Intelligence score. This determines how effective a character is at intelligence-related skills and actions. It also determines how effective a character is at casting spells, if they are playing an intelligence-based spellcasting class.\n\n-   **Wis:** Wisdom score.
