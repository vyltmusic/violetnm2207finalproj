Players roleplay as characters that they create, rolling dice to determine the success of actions they take and adding bonuses to their rolls determined by the statistics of their characters.\n\n## Character Creation in DnD 5e\n\nIn DnD 5e, players create a character that they will roleplay as, using a system with specific rules to construct such a character with certain choices, such as the character's class and race, or how good or bad they are at six specific abilities: their strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.\n\nWhile this is a very simplified summary, the reality is that creating a DnD 5e character can be a complicated and daunting process due to all the possibilities, especially for a new player. Some players may want to know what the general trends of DnD statistics tend to be for certain 'character builds' that they intend to play - a term for specific combinations of general character creation choices, often focused on class. An example is the 'Sorlock', a term for a popular character build involving levels in both the Sorcerer and Warlock classes.\n\n## Statistics of Particular DnD 5e Character Builds at Certain Levels\n\nThe statistics of a DnD 5e character is determined by the allocation of certain limited resources and choices, for instances the six core ability scores of a DnD 5e character - Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha (see FAQ) - are constructed from a limited pool of points that the player must distribute carefully. By knowing the general trends of how other players develop their characters' DnD statistics, a new player can have a better idea of how to allocate their resources during character creation.\n\n## References\n\n<https://www.dndbeyond.com/how-to-play-dnd>\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nAre you a new player getting into DnD 5e?
