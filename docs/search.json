    "text": "Discussion\nPlaying around with the interactive visualizer above, you can discover certain findings about the distribution of statistics for different DnD characters. For one, Fighters are by far the most popular class choice in the dataset with the highest observation count of 1144, making up almost 14% of the entire sample size.\nLet’s imagine, for example, that you are a new player looking to play as a Fighter in a level 5 campaign. In the visualizer settings, you can select only the Fighter Class, select ‘Show characters with only the selected classes’ and set both the minimum and maximum level to 5. You’ll notice that even with an IQR scaling factor of 3, no outliers are detected, so don’t worry about that setting.\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter\n\n\n\nDnD Statistics of Fighters\nNow, let’s look at the statistics of this sample! Try switching between the different DnD stats. You will notice that different DnD statistics can have different distributions.\nFor example, Strength scores tend to be skewed to the right, implying that Fighters tend to be biased towards high Strength scores.\nDexterity scores are more multimodal – there are multiple notable peaks in the distribution. This suggests that there are perhaps multiple different play-styles for Fighters with varying focus on Dexterity.\nIntelligence scores, meanwhile, seems slightly skewed to the left. This might suggest that Fighters tend towards lower Intelligence scores, which is funny given the popular and rather humorous stereotype that Fighters typically aren’t very bright!\n\n\nSummary Statistics of Fighter Ability Scores\nHere is a second data visualizer looking specifically at Fighters from the dataset, and how the means, medians and modes (see FAQ) of their six core ability scores compare to each other at varying tiers of gameplay. Gameplay tiers in DnD 5e are split into Tier 1 (levels 1 - 4), Tier 2 (levels 5 - 10), Tier 3 (levels 11 - 16) and Tier 4 (levels 17 - 20) due to the way DnD 5e gameplay progression is nonlinear.\n\n\n(Data source: https://github.com/oganm/dnddata)\nTo analyse the context of a Fighter in a level 5 campaign, you can select ‘No’ for including multiclass fighters, select the ‘Median’ summary statistic (a more accurate summary statistic for skewed datasets) and then set the gameplay tier to ‘Tier 2’.\nFrom the generated bar graph, you can more clearly see that generally, fighters invest more into their Strength, Dexterity and Constitution (typically more combat-oriented statistics) than their Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma (typically more roleplay-oriented statistics). This is not particularly surprising, and indeed it further supports the Fighter stereotype – at least for Tier 2, their Intelligence on average is their lowest ability score!\nWhat is even more interesting, however, is the comparison between the average Strength and Dexterity scores for Fighters. Strength is typically more invested in for character builds focused on close-range combat with melee weapons, whereas Dexterity is more invested in for character builds focused on long-distance combat with ranged weapons. These are two play-styles that, on paper, Fighters can be equally effective in. The data however suggests that Fighter players are biased towards close-quarters combat, as Tier 2 Fighters have a median Strength score of 18 and a median Dexterity score of 14. A new player torn between the two play-styles could thus take this data into consideration. Perhaps close-quarters Fighters are more popular because that sort of play-style is generally more fun!\n\n\nTrends at Higher Levels of Gameplay\nCreating a character for a certain campaign’s level is just fine as is, but let’s say you know that the campaign that you’re joining is intended to be a long-term one that will span many levels, maybe going into different gameplay tiers eventually. You could also take this into account when using the data visualizers provided on this website!\nTry changing the tiers of the second data visualizer and compare the difference in Fighter ability score medians across different gameplay tiers. You may notice that, unsurprisingly, the medians of the ability scores generally go up with higher tiers. However, a closer look reveals that not all ability scores increase at the same rate. Strength, Dexterity and Constitution, the scores that we’ve established as more combat-oriented, increase at greater rates than Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma, the roleplay-oriented scores. In fact, between Tiers 2 and 3, the median scores of Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma for Fighters do not even change at all, and the median Intelligence score remains the exact same at 11 across all four tiers!\nThis can provide insight into how character progression may play out in terms of statistics across levels. You can design your character with these future statistical progressions in mind, for instance planning to choose specific features that compliment certain ability scores when you reach higher levels that grant you access to such choices."

Some players may want to know what the general trends of DnD statistics tend to be for certain ‘character builds’ that they intend to play - a term for specific combinations of general character creation choices, often focused on class. An example is the ‘Sorlock’, a term for a popular character build involving levels in both the Sorcerer and Warlock classes."

We refer to the term ‘statistics’ in two contexts:\n\n\n‘DnD Statistics’ refers to specific variable values in a player’s character sheet.

This determines how difficult it is for an enemy to hit the character with an attack.\nStr: Strength score. This determines how effective a character is at strength-related skills and actions, including how well they attack with certain types of strength-based weapons.\nDex: Dexterity score.

Examples of descriptive statistics include the following:\n\nMean: The average value of a numerical dataset. Calculated by dividing the sum of the entire dataset by its sample size.\nMedian: The middle-point value of a numerical dataset. Calculated by arranging the entire dataset in either ascending or descending order, then taking either the middlemost value, or the average of the two middlemost values if the dataset total is even.\nMode: The most frequently-occurring value of a dataset.\nQuartiles: Values that evenly divide a numerical dataset into quarters. Calculated similarly to a median, except you take the 25%, 50% and 75% point values or average of two values, giving you the first, second and third quartile, AKA Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively. The second quartile (the 50% point value) is equal to the median.\nInterquartile Range (IQR): The range between the first quartile and third quartile. Calculated by subtracting Q1 from Q3.\nOutliers: Values in a dataset that lie very far from the rest of the data. A high outlier is calculated by checking if its value is less than Q1 - [scaling factor] * IQR, while a low outlier is calculated by checking if its value is greater than Q3 + [scaling factor] * IQR.\n\nA scaling factor of 1.5 is used to detect mild outliers, while a scaling factor of 3 is used to detect extreme outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bar graph is a fairly straightforward way to visualize data with categorical variables – variables that are organized by discrete categories, as opposed to numerical values.
