    "text": "Character Creation in DnD 5e\nIn DnD 5e, players create a character that they will roleplay as, using a system with specific rules to construct such a character with certain choices, such as the character’s class and race, or how good or bad they are at six specific abilities: their strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.\nWhile this is a very simplified summary, the reality is that creating a DnD 5e character can be a complicated and daunting process due to all the possibilities, especially for a new player. Some players may want to know what the general trends of DnD statistics tend to be for certain ‘character builds’ that they intend to play - a term for specific combinations of general character creation choices, often focused on class. An example is the ‘Sorlock’, a term for a popular character build involving levels in both the Sorcerer and Warlock classes."

    "text": "A distinction in terminology is needed on this website. We refer to the term ‘statistics’ in two contexts:\n\n\n‘DnD Statistics’ refers to specific variable values in a player’s character sheet. The ones we will be focusing on in this website are:\n\nHP: Hit points. This determines how much damage a character can take before being ‘downed’.\nAC: Armor class. This determines how difficult it is for an enemy to hit the character with an attack.\nStr: Strength score. This determines how effective a character is at strength-related skills and actions, including how well they attack with certain types of strength-based weapons.\nDex: Dexterity score. This determines how effective a character is at dexterity-related skills and actions, including how well they attack with certain types of dexterity-based weapons. A character’s Dex also determines how fast they act in turn order during combat, and sometimes affects their AC as well.\nCon: Constitution score. This determines how effective a character is at resisting health-related effects, as well as how much HP a character has.\nInt: Intelligence score. This determines how effective a character is at intelligence-related skills and actions. It also determines how effective a character is at casting spells, if they are playing an intelligence-based spellcasting class.\nWis: Wisdom score. This determines how effective a character is at wisdom-related skills and actions. It also determines how effective a character is at casting spells, if they are playing a wisdom-based spellcasting class.\nCha: Charisma score. This determines how effective a character is at charisma-related skills and actions. It also determines how effective a character is at casting spells, if they are playing a wisdom-based spellcasting class.\n\n\n\n\n‘Descriptive Statistics’ refer to the statistics of data itself – specifically statistical values that help ‘describe’ a dataset.
