Welcome to Violet's Guide to DnD 5e Character Statistics!

Are you a new player getting into DnD 5e? Having trouble creating your first ever character? Well, perhaps this website will be of use to you!

## What is DnD 5e?

DnD 5e stands for 'Dungeons and Dragons, Fifth Edition', a tabletop role-playing game. Players roleplay as characters that they create, rolling dice to determine the success of actions they take and adding bonuses to their rolls determined by the statistics of their characters.

## Character Creation in DnD 5e

In DnD 5e, players create a character that they will roleplay as, using a system with specific rules to construct such a character with certain choices, such as the character's class and race, or how good or bad they are at six specific abilities: their strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.

While this is a very simplified summary, the reality is that creating a DnD 5e character can be a complicated and daunting process due to all the possibilities, especially for a new player. Some players may want to know what the general trends of DnD statistics tend to be for certain 'character builds' that they intend to play - a term for specific combinations of general character creation choices, often focused on class. An example is the 'Sorlock', a term for a popular character build involving levels in both the Sorcerer and Warlock classes.

## Statistics of Particular DnD 5e Character Builds at Certain Levels

The statistics of a DnD 5e character is determined by the allocation of certain limited resources and choices, for instances the six core ability scores of a DnD 5e character - Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha (see FAQ) - are constructed from a limited pool of points that the player must distribute carefully. By knowing the general trends of how other players develop their characters' DnD statistics, a new player can have a better idea of how to allocate their resources during character creation.
